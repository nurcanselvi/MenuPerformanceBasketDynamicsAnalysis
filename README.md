### 📊 Project Overview
> This project examines one year of transactional sales data from a fast-food restaurant to understand **what truly drives revenue** — whether growth comes from higher order frequency, larger baskets, specific menu items, or particular operating hours.
> 

> Rather than listing descriptive metrics, the analysis is structured to reveal **where the business earns its money and under which conditions**, creating a foundation for pricing, menu focus, and operational timing decisions.
