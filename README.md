# 🍔 MenuPerformanceBasketDynamicsAnalysis
The project examines how revenue is formed across basket sizes, product roles, and dayparts, translating item-level transactions into structured business insights.

### 📊 Project Overview
> This project examines one year of transactional sales data from a fast-food restaurant to understand **what truly drives revenue** — whether growth comes from higher order frequency, larger baskets, specific menu items, or particular operating hours.
> 

> Rather than listing descriptive metrics, the analysis is structured to reveal **where the business earns its money and under which conditions**, creating a foundation for pricing, menu focus, and operational timing decisions.
>

### 🎯 Project Objective
> The objective of this project is to use SQL-based analysis to identify the primary drivers of sales performance — distinguishing between **order volume**, **basket size**, **product-level contribution** within the menu, and **time-of-day effects.**
> 

> The goal is not to predict outcomes, but to clarify **where performance is structurally coming from,** enabling more informed decisions around menu prioritization and operating focus.

### 📖 Dataset Description
> The dataset consists of 1,000 item-level transactions recorded between **April 2022** and **March 2023**, where each row represents a single order. Key columns include item details (item_name, item_price), order metrics (quantity, transaction_amount), and temporal/operational context (date, time_of_sale, transaction_type).
>

>The structure allows analysis at both the order level (basket size, order value) and the item level (menu mix, price positioning), while temporal fields enable daypart-based performance comparisons.
