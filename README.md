# 🍔 MenuPerformanceBasketDynamicsAnalysis
The project examines how revenue is formed across basket sizes, product roles, and dayparts, translating item-level transactions into structured business insights.

### 📊 Project Overview
> This project examines one year of transactional sales data from a fast-food restaurant to understand **what truly drives revenue** — whether growth comes from higher order frequency, larger baskets, specific menu items, or particular operating hours.
> 

> Rather than listing descriptive metrics, the analysis is structured to reveal **where the business earns its money and under which conditions**, creating a foundation for pricing, menu focus, and operational timing decisions.
>

### 🎯 Project Objective
> > The objective of this project is to use SQL-based analysis to identify the primary drivers of sales performance — distinguishing between **order volume**, **basket size**, **product-level contribution** within the menu, and **time-of-day effects.**
> 

> The goal is not to predict outcomes, but to clarify **where performance is structurally coming from,** enabling more informed decisions around menu prioritization and operating focus.
